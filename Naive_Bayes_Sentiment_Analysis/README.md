# Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their content. The project uses the NLTK movie review corpus, which is divided into training, development, and testing sets.

## Dataset
The project uses the following datasets:
- **NLTK Movie Review Corpus**: A collection of movie reviews labeled with sentiment (positive/negative). The data is split into training (80%), development (10%), and testing (10%) sets.
- **Toy Corpus from Jurafsky and Martin**: A smaller dataset used for initial testing and experimentation, described in the book "Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky and Martin.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Tokenized reviews, organized into separate files for training, development, and testing.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implementation of a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify reviews based on their sentiment.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the classifier on the training set, tuning on the development set, and evaluating the final model.

## Dependencies
- Python
- NLTK
- Numpy

## Implementation Details
The implementation involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess the movie review data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the reviews to be used by the Naive Bayes classifier.
3. **Model Training**: Train the Naive Bayes classifier on the training set.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the development set and fine-tune as necessary.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd naive-bayes-sentiment-analysis
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Classifier**:
    ```sh
    python naive_bayes.py
    ```

## Results
The classifier achieves high accuracy on the sentiment classification task, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. By working with real-world datasets and experimenting with different features, I gained valuable insights into the application of machine learning techniques in natural language processing.
