# Logistic Regression Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a logistic regression classifier for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The aim is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative by leveraging various features and optimizing the classifier's performance through hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
The project uses the following datasets:
- **NLTK Movie Review Corpus**: A collection of movie reviews labeled with sentiment (positive/negative), divided into training (80%), development (10%), and testing (10%) sets.
- **Toy Corpus from Jurafsky and Martin**: A smaller dataset used for initial testing and experimentation, described in the book "Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky and Martin.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the movie review data into feature vectors.
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**: Implement and train a logistic regression model using Numpy and Scipy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different types of features, including word counts, lexicon counts, binary word features, and document statistics.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on the training set, tune it on the development set, and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Numpy
- Scipy
- NLTK

## Implementation Details
The implementation involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess the movie review data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the reviews to be used by the logistic regression classifier.
3. **Model Training**: Train the logistic regression classifier using mini-batch gradient descent.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the development set using precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd logistic-regression-sentiment-analysis
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Classifier**:
    ```sh
    python logistic_regression.py
    ```

## Results
The classifier achieves high accuracy on the sentiment classification task by experimenting with various features and optimizing hyperparameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for text classification.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on implementation of a logistic regression classifier for sentiment analysis. By working with real-world datasets and experimenting with different features and hyperparameters, I gained valuable insights into the application of machine learning techniques in natural language processing.
